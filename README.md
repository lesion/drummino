========

atmega328 standard MIDI device using capacitive touch sensors

I'm using the [v-usb](https://github.com/obdev/v-usb) firmware to emulate
a real USB controller. 

Makefile needs https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/blob/master/Arduino.mk
in /usr/share/arduino/ (packaged version from debian/ubuntu and derivated does not work because they
does not include .S files)

The demo here is done using [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/)
